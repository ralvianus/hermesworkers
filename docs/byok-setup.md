# BYOK Setup

`hermesworkers` never ships a provider key. Every chat request runs against **your** API credentials, billed by **your** provider account. This guide explains how to wire each supported provider.

## Supported providers

| Provider     | Hermes model id format               | Get a key                                                  |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| Anthropic    | `anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5`, etc.  | <https://console.anthropic.com/settings/keys>              |
| OpenRouter   | `openrouter/<vendor>/<model>`        | <https://openrouter.ai/keys>                               |
| OpenAI       | `openai/gpt-4.1`, etc.               | <https://platform.openai.com/api-keys>                     |

You only need a key for the provider(s) whose models you want to call. Hermes routes to the provider based on the `model` prefix in each chat request.

## Push the secret

```bash
npm run secret -- put ANTHROPIC_API_KEY     # repeat for OPENROUTER_API_KEY / OPENAI_API_KEY
```

Wrangler asks for the value on the command line. The secret is stored encrypted on Cloudflare and only readable by your Worker at runtime.

## How the Worker uses it

On every container boot, the Worker:

1. Reads the secret from the Cloudflare environment.
2. Passes it to `startProcess('/usr/local/bin/start-hermes.sh', { env: {...} })`.
3. The startup script materialises `~/.hermes/.env` with the keys present in the environment.
4. Hermes loads `~/.hermes/.env` on launch and registers each provider whose key it finds.

The secret never lands in:

- the container image layers (it isn't baked in at build time),
- the Worker's deployed bundle (it's a runtime secret),
- Cloudflare logs (the Worker only reads it; it doesn't print it).

## Rotating a key

```bash
npm run secret -- put ANTHROPIC_API_KEY     # paste the new value
curl -X POST "$WORKER_URL/api/instance/restart-gateway" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $API_TOKEN"
```

`restart-gateway` keeps the container alive but tears down the Hermes processes so the next request reads the new `~/.hermes/.env`.

## Setting the default model

If a caller hits `/v1/chat/completions` without specifying a `model`, Hermes falls back to its default. Override it via:

```bash
# Plain env var in wrangler.local.toml [vars] section
[vars]
HERMES_DEFAULT_MODEL = "anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5"

# Or push as a secret if you'd rather not commit the value
npm run secret -- put HERMES_DEFAULT_MODEL
```

Common choices:

- `anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5` — current Anthropic default.
- `openrouter/anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5` — same model, billed through OpenRouter.
- `openai/gpt-4.1` — OpenAI flagship.

## Checking what Hermes sees

```bash
curl -s "$WORKER_URL/api/instance/logs" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $API_TOKEN" | jq -r '.stdout' | head -40
```

The "HERMES STATUS" section should show `✓` next to each provider whose key you've pushed. If you see `✗`, the secret isn't reaching `~/.hermes/.env` — re-check spelling and re-run `restart-gateway`.

## Using Cloudflare AI Gateway (optional)

Cloudflare AI Gateway can sit between Hermes and the upstream provider, giving you logging, caching, analytics, rate limiting and guardrails. Push two secrets and every inference call (chat and the agent's auxiliary tasks) routes through it — no script changes needed:

```bash
npm run secret -- put HERMES_AI_GATEWAY_URL
npm run secret -- put HERMES_INFERENCE_TOKEN
```

Two supported shapes:

| Mode | `HERMES_AI_GATEWAY_URL` | `HERMES_INFERENCE_TOKEN` | Notes |
| ---- | ----------------------- | ------------------------ | ----- |
| Pass-through | `https://gateway.ai.cloudflare.com/v1/<account_id>/<gateway_id>/openrouter/v1` | your OpenRouter key | Keeps free models and OpenRouter's own rate limits; the key passes through the gateway. |
| REST API / Unified Billing | `https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/accounts/<account_id>/ai/v1` | Cloudflare API token (**Account → Workers AI → Read**) | Catalog models (`openai/gpt-4.1`, `anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5`, …) billed through Cloudflare; no OpenRouter caps. Load credits first. |

Model ids in `HERMES_DEFAULT_MODEL` must match what the gateway's upstream expects: OpenRouter ids in pass-through mode, `author/model` catalog ids in REST API mode, and `@cf/author/model` for Workers AI models. **Workers AI (`@cf/...`) models require the `cf-aig-gateway-id` header** — push the gateway id via `HERMES_AI_GATEWAY_ID` (falls back to `default`); the startup script exports it through the OpenAI SDK's native `OPENAI_CUSTOM_HEADERS` support, which covers every client Hermes constructs.

Redeploy or call `POST /api/instance/restart-gateway` after changing either secret. Requests can also target a specific gateway with the `cf-aig-gateway-id` header — with Hermes, encode the gateway id in the URL instead.

See the [Cloudflare AI Gateway docs](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ai-gateway/) for gateway configuration (caching, rate limiting, guardrails, BYOK key storage).
